## Use of this StarterKit is Deprecated
It is now possible to create a project with the same configuration as this StarterKit using our new project template for Visual Studio or the .NET CLI, as explained in the [Introduction](https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/introduction)
With the new project template there are even more configurable options. This StarterKit is still maintained as a reference but it is much better to start new projects with the project template.

# Using SimpleContent with cloudscribe Core and Entity Framework Core

[SimpleContent](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe.SimpleContent) is a simple, yet flexible content and blog engine for ASP.NET Core.

This sample uses [cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) for user authentication and Entity Framework/SqlServer storage for content and data.

[cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) is a multi-tenant web application foundation. It provides multi-tenant identity management for sites, users, and roles.

When you run it from Visual Studio it should initilaize a new localdb on the first run. 

You can login with admin@admin.com as the username and admin as the password

Be sure to update the credentials before deployment.
