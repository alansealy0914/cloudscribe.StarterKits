## Use of this StarterKit is Deprecated
It is now possible to create a project with the same configuration as this StarterKit using our new project template for Visual Studio or the .NET CLI, as explained in the [Introduction](https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/introduction)
With the new project template there are even more configurable options. This StarterKit is still maintained as a reference but it is much better to start new projects with the project template.

# Using cloudscribe Core and NoDb 

This sample uses [cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) for user authentication and [NoDb](https://github.com/joeaudette/NoDb) file system storage for content and data. 

[cloudscribe Core](https://github.com/joeaudette/cloudscribe) is a multi-tenant web application foundation. It provides multi-tenant identity management for sites, users, and roles.

[NoDb](https://github.com/joeaudette/NoDb) is a "No Database" file system storage, it is also a "NoSql" storage system.

When you run it you can login to either site with admin@admin.com as the username and admin as the password.

Be sure to update the credentials before deployment.
